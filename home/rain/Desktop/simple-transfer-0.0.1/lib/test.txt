A syntax form. 
In Ruby we apply the string format syntax (the "%" operator) to ease this creation of formatted string data. 
After the "%" we specify arguments.

A first example. 
We use the percentage sign ("%") to specify a format code within a string. 
And we also apply the "%" sign after the string, to indicate the arguments.
